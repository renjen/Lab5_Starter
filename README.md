**Check Your Understanding:**

1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature? Why or why not?  
→ No, because the message feature involves multiple components and behaviors (writing and sending), which require integration or end-to-end testing rather than unit tests.

2) Would you unit test the “max message length” feature? Why or why not?  
→ Yes, because this logic (checking if length ≤ 80) is a simple, self-contained function and ideal for a unit test.
