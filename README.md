Explore Part 3:
1. Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature?
No, because the message feature includes both writing and sending the message, which involves multiple components and interactions. That’s better tested with integration or end-to-end tests.
2. Would you unit test “max message length” feature?
Yes, it’s a small, isolated logic (like checking string length ≤ 80), so it’s perfect for unit testing.
